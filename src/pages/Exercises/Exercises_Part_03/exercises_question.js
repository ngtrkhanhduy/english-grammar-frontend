            Dear Female Employees,

            Only one week remains until registration will be closed for the Women's Leadership Seminar. This seminar is offered free of charge to all of our female employees at Simnet Solutions. To accommodate our female employees' busy schedules, identical seminars will be held on two different datesâ€”February 21 and February 23. In order to register for this specially designed seminar, you must e-mail James Taylor in human resources by 5:00 PM. on February 12. This seminar will teach our female employees about how to communicate with confidence and credibility in the workplace.
