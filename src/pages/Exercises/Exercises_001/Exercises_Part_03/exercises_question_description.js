            <p>Dear Female Employees,</p>

            <p>
                Only one week remains until registration will be closed for the Women's Leadership Seminar. This seminar
                is offered free of charge to all of our female employees at Simnet Solutions. To accommodate our female
                employees' busy schedules, identical seminars will be held on two different dates—February 21 and
                February 23. In order to register for this specially designed seminar, you must e-mail James Taylor in
                human resources by 5:00 PM on February 12. This seminar will teach our female employees about how to
                communicate with confidence and credibility in the workplace. The Simnet Solutions Management Team

                Nancy, it's Kyle. I'm in conference room B setting up for the meeting at 5. The projector doesn't work.
                Can you search for another in the supply room?

                Kyle, there are no projectors here. I've called the IT department and asked if they have any spare ones.
                I'll get back to you when I get a reply.

                There are two here. I'll take them both. Meanwhile, the IT department says they don't have extra
                projectors but they'll send a guy down now to check what's wrong. They say it worked fine at yesterday's
                presentation.

            <p>Community Victory</p>

            <p>
                After a months-long battle to stop the development of a new shopping mall on the location of the former
                Rivervalley Courthouse, residents, local businesses, and civic groups are cheering the decision to keep
                the 150-year-old building intact. —[1]— "We're dissappointed," added Branford Construction's CEO. "We
                felt that the community would benefit and grow, but obviously, residents want to preserve their history
                and I respect that!"
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, efforts are being made to restore the old deserted courthouse to its former glory. -[2]- "The
                community is getting together for this and we are collecting donations to have the building renovated,"
                said local resident Enid Tran. "We hope to make a public library or school out of the building."
            </p>

            <p>
                -[3]- "It's been here for as long as I can remember. In fact, my grandfather worked as a clerk there,"
                added a local business owner, Kevin Lamb, "It's an iconic symbol of our community and we don't want it
                destroyed." The community has already raised over $100,000 through an online petition and donations keep
                pouring in. —[4]— The community hopes that restoration of the building begins within the next couple of
                months.

            <p>Dear Ms. Johnson,</p>

            <p>
                District Management at Topline Electronics would like to inform you about a new development that will be
                affecting your store. Another competing consumer electronics store will be opening in the Crayville area
                on November 12.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to ensure that Topline Electronics does not lose business to this new store, District
                Management is advising you to run a special sale on our new line of curved UHD televisions. These
                televisions provide state-of-the-art features at moderate prices. By showing your customers that Topline
                Electronics offers the best deals in the area, you will be able to maintain customer loyalty. We will be
                shipping the new televisions to your store within the next week. We suggest you prepare a prominent
                display space in your store to feature them. You should also update your website to advertise the sale.
            </p>

            <p>
                Smooth communication between you and us is vital to effective operational practices. If you have any
                questions concerning the new televisions or the marketing campaign in general, please don't hesitate to
                contact District Management.
            </p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>

                No, because I want to get a definitive answer from our manufacturers first before I relay any sort of a

                scheduled. The desks and chairs will arrive directly at P&R Industries from the assembly lines on
                Thursday.

                Yes, please make sure that the job is done not only efficiently but also well. They have a couple of
                other buildings that they may want our services for.

                16 July, Newtown—Health Shack is downtown Newtown's hottest new hangout for fitness buffs and corporate
                employees alike. —[1]— Owners Jill and Barry Baker opened the shop last month to rave reviews and long
                lines. Getting a seat or table at Health Shack can take as long as 30 minutes on a good day and the
                place is always crowded no matter the time of day. Health Shack offers only six items on its menu; all
                are protein shakes including the best sellers, Apple Pie, Peanut Butter Cup, and Tuity Fruity. —[2]— "We
                were overwhelmed by the response," says Jill Baker. "In fact, everything spread by word of mouth so we
                didn't even need to advertise." Fitness Instructor Julian Miles said, "I love coming here for a quick
                lunch that won't wreck my fitness goals. I even recommend this place to all my patrons." —[3]- "I come
                here to get a healthy but satisfying meal during my short break with my co-workers," added businessman
                Tim Hammer. "Without Health Shack, we'd be eating junk food." —[4]— Health Shack is open from 7:00 A.M.
                to 8:00 P.M. from Mondays through Fridays, and from 9:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. on Saturdays. It closes on
                Sundays. The owners hope to add new flavors to the menu in the coming months.

                The Department of City Planning is excited to announce a summer lecture series that will be focusing on
                budgeting issues that concern local residents and municipalities. Financial management is one of the

            <p>
                I work for Facilities Management here at Wurnster University. It was recently brought to my attention
                that there is a scheduling conflict concerning one of your lecture dates. Room 305 has been reserved for
                every Wednesday this semester by the Wurnster Debate Club. Therefore, I'm sorry to inform you that you
                will need to move the location or the time of this talk. You can visit the facilities management website
                in order to check the availability of other room locations and reschedule the talk.
            </p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            </p>

            <p>
                We received your e-mail on Tuesday, December 4, inquiring about our wedding planning and event services.
                We specialize in all kinds of weddings (small or large-scale, indoor or outdoor, and various kinds of
                decors tailored to your dream wedding). We are sure to have a solution just right for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                You wrote that you want a wedding package that is less than $5,000 and that will be held at a large
                venue close to a major highway because you expect many guests from all over the country. As I understand
                it, your other preferences are as follows:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>An outdoor venue</li>
                <li>A photographer and videographer available at all times for documentation</li>
                <li>Decorations including colorful flowers and elegant tablecloths</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I've attached a list of all our possible wedding packages that you might be interested in. They are all
                located within 15 minutes' drive of Highway 519. Please look through the provided information to decide
                which location fits your needs best. Once you have made a decision, please inform me via e-mail when you
                would like the wedding to be held. This will help me secure a reservation for you.
            </p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>
                My name is Emily Hall and I am the owner of a vegetarian restaurant located in downtown Huntsville. I am
                contacting you because I am interested in receiving regular shipments of fresh, organic vegetables to my
                restaurant weekly. My restaurant is just starting, so I do not need a large quantity of goods. After
                looking into different farms in the area, I chose to contact Bountiful Harvest because of your promise
                to deliver certified organic food. Therefore, I would like to receive a price estimate for the cost of
                having fresh vegetables delivered directly to our restaurant on a weekly basis.

                Thanks for contacting our farm. At Bountiful Harvest, we offer fresh organic produce that can be

                field and delivered immediately, which means that you are getting wholesome, nutritious, organic produce
                to serve at your restaurant. We also offer additional items such as fresh meat, cheese, and milk. Below

                Thank you for responding so promptly to my email. I appreciate the offer of the complimentary delivery,
                but I think I would like to just go ahead and set up regular deliveries. I may be interested in setting
                up a year's worth of deliveries, but I would first like to get a list of the range of produce that you
                will be offering through the different seasons. As I own a vegetarian restaurant, I will need to have an
                idea of the types of produce that will be delivered so I can prepare my menus accordingly. Thank you so
                much for your consideration, and I look forward to working with Bountiful Harvest!
            </p>

                not meet our high standards of product quality.
            </p>

            <p>
                The defect has been caused by an improper seal on the lid of the jar and may have resulted in the
                contents spoiling due to contact with air. We are currently warning customers not to eat this product.
            </p>

            <p>
                My name is Tony Hester and I appreciate the precautionary step. Around two weeks ago I purchased two
                jars of Castelli's Classic Spaghetti Sauce from an Ace grocery store in Hermantown, Minnesota. A week
                later, I purchased one more jar of it at the same place.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have attached the image file of both receipts to this e-mail. I would like to receive a product
                replacement voucher for these defective products. My address is:

            <p>Dear employees,</p>

            <p>
                The results from our recent inspection on January 22 indicate that there are a few problems that we need
                to address.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, it was brought to my attention that fire exit signs need to be installed again. The most serious
                violation concerned the improper storage and labeling of food. All ingredients stored for later use must
                be labeled with an exact date and detailed contents. If we do not label containers properly, spoiled
                food could accidently be served to customers. We received relatively low grades for employee hygiene and
                the cleanliness of our facilities. All employees are required to wear their uniform and hairnet at all
                times and wash their hands after every bathroom visit. We also need to mop floors more often and keep
                them dry.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to correct these poor situations, I will be posting a checklist that all employees will be
                required to complete every morning. It will include necessary preparations to ensure that we are not
                breaking any regulations. This measure will go into effect on January 29.
            </p>

            <p>If you have any questions about these changes, please bring them up at the staff meeting tomorrow.</p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Notice to All Employees</h3>
            <p>
                The checklist below must be signed by every employee on every day that they have a shift at Polito's
                Pizza. Only sign the task once it has been completed or checked. Failure to fill out the checklist with
                the date, time, and signature will be treated as a violation of Polito's new health standards.
            </p>
